## About the Project ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
In this project we are doing WhatApp chat analysis as WhatsApp is one of the most used messenger applications today with more than 2 Billion users worldwide. It was found that more than 65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp daily so we can use WhatsApp chats for analyzing our chat with a friend, customer, or a group of people.The same can be done with other social media apps as well. To analyse the Whatsapp chats ,I have extracted WhatsApp data from my smartphone which is a very easy task. To extract  WhatsApp chats, just open any chat with a person or a group and follow the steps mentioned below:

- [ ] If you are having an iPhone then tap on the Contact Name or the Group Name. In case you are having an Android smartphone then tap on the 3 dots above.
- [ ] Then scroll to the bottom and top on Export Chat.
- [ ] Then select without media for simplicity if it asks you whether you want your chats with or without media.
- [ ] Then email this chat to yourself and download it to your system
